 -  Object detection (current method for OCR),
 -  PCB inspection (siamese nets),
 -  Visual kinship recognition (for a time),
 -  Truck classification, and
 -  Metabolomics (no more).

Skills
  - Frameworks
    - TensorFlow / Keras
    - PyTorch / PyTorchLightning (main tools)
  - ...
  - Languages
    - Python (main)
    - R (no more)
  - MLOps tooling, like DVC.

You will see here a lot of things from my `dotfiles` (neovim, i3, etc.) to my note-taking scripts. They are more or less updated.

Also, you will see that I have a range of interests like natural language processing, computer vision, and explainable AI. Right now I don't have anything that I find great to show you, but someday I will have them here for sure.

My blog is right at the left if you want to know more about me (WIP and currently not a priority).
