Currently, I am doing machine and deep learning applied to metabolomics and visual kinship recognition.


You will see here a lot of things from my `dotfiles` (neovim, i3, etc.) to my note-taking scripts. They are more or less updated.

Also, you will see that I have a range of interests like natural language processing, computer vision, and explainable AI. Right now I don't have anything that I find great to show you, but someday I will have them here for sure.

My blog is right at the left if you want to know more about me.
